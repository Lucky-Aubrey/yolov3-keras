# YOLOv3 with keras

This folder doesnt have:

- conversion of COCO weights from pjreddie website to tensorflow format (very hard to do from scratch)
- conversion of noise dataset (XML-data) to tf.records or tf.dataset format (can be done from scratch)


github_load_datasets should not be deleted. Rename it instead if into something without "github"
